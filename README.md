# Social Network APIs

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with writing some back end APIs for a generic social network using Mongoose, the latest tool we've been working with. This was an even numbered week so we were given no starter code for this challenge, but some of the lessons we did gave us an idea of what the directory structure should look like. Overall, I think I prefer working with MongoDB and Mongoose to MySQL and Sequelize. I got some solid experience with MongoDB and Mongoose while creating this project, as well as more experience writing API routes and models, but with a slightly different syntax.

## Installation

This database is not deployed to Heroku, so to use the database, you will need to fork this repo so that you can clone it to your local system and run `npm i && npm run seed && npm start` and you will be able to start making requests with Insomnia. The seeds only contains seed data for users, not thoughts or reactions.

## Usage

After completing the required steps above, you will be able to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the `/api/users` and `/api/thoughts` routes as well as others. To see all the available routes, look at the userRoutes.js and thoughtRoutes.js in the /routes/api/ directory.
